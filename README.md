# Redux quiz group project

This was a Week 13 project @Technigo Frontend Bootcamp made by Julia Nikitina, Elsa Carlstr√∂m, Mamite Andersson and Louise Becker. The assignment was to create a multiple choice quiz using React with Redux for global storage.

## The problem

We started by planning the theme and overall look of the project using Jamboard before addressing the main logic and structure of the quiz. We learned to use selectors and dispatch to trigger Redux actions and it enabled us to interact with the store and to change it. We used the Redux dev tools to inspect the store to see what it contains and how it updates. When this was in place we started implementing the styling using styled-components. When the main styling was done we proceeded to apply specific styling in reaction to the flow of the game (like the right answer becoming green when selected) and creating more components for this.

Additional features we applied includes progress bar, highlighting the current answer if the user choose incorrectly and the summary with information about what was answered correctly and what the correct answer was. If we would have more time we would have implemented a timer.
